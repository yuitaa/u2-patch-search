- New: 26 additional soundtrack versions added for night/rain/ebb. Each existing soundtrack will dynamically transition to another version at night, when it’s raining and during ebb/tide (on island interchange)
- New: Sound effects for the new Action-Cartridges added
- Improvement: Darker player UI color palette for more contrast
- Balance: Torpeboss has a more lava focus attack pattern if players are building far ahead
- Balance: Extra life cartridge is now rare, cap at 4 (before it was 10). After respawning once, you only 1 heart until the next station where you get all replenished
- Revert: Reverted bucket buffing with radius
- Change: Players can drink out of the bucket only when carrying something**
- Change: 13 wagons is the max for now. It’s actually the same as before but we make it explicit, to avoid wagons bugging around in the shop. We can think of increasing the limit if there is interest for it
- Improvement: When throwing a bucket and it was being emptied, it’ll visually fly back to the thrower
- Improvement: Magnet perk gets now only milk out of the bucket when the player has no temporary buff yet (and the player is carrying something)
- Bug fix: Players dropped tools when trying to drink milk with a tool
- Bug fix: Custom maps had the wrong biome background
- Bug fix: Bucket icon in bucket-bubble was sometimes wrong
- Bug fix: Filling bucket with milk sometimes showed the waterbar
- Bug fix: Torpeboss could be killed by moving a water tower on it
