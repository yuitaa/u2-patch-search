- New: Blocklist introduced. After kicking a player you can choose to block them as well. You can also block players from replays or custom map creators. The blocklist can be configured in the online settings. Blocked players can’t join your lobby and you can’t open replays or maps from then. Players can be globally blocked by us in rare cases. If globally blocked, you can’t make your lobby public anymore.
