- New: Labyrinth can now also appear in Time Attack mode
- Improvement: Octoboss is now also visible and animated in the blueprint area after its boss map
- Improvement: Labyrinth Boss improvements (longer, more narrow map, a bit more aggressive)
- Improvement: Miner wagon shows the mining width now in its stats
- Bug fix: Miner did double mine the same entities in the same wave (it should only reduce 1 health with each wave)
