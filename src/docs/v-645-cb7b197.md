- Improvement: When placing on a carriage, the stack is highlighted if it contains already items
- Improvement: Version Incompatible replays will be deleted automatically
- Improvement: Faster game loading for players who played many games (game needs to restart once for that).
- Bug fix: The camera did some reset movement in replays sometimes
- Bug fix: Animals could die when having multiple carriage wagons with front-pull extensions
- Bug fix: It was possible to apply the “Storage Pull” extension to the wagon printer which did not do anything
- Bug fix: Marathon cartridge didn’t spawn in endless mode
- Bug fix: The bot was sometimes stealing from transformer wagon input stacks even though they were the critical wagon to produce the missing resource
- Bug fix: Custom map replays (often) did not count to highscore when playing online
- Bug fix: It wasn’t possible to pick up from some wagons (like carriage) at a station in time attack mode
- Bug fix: Versus & Custom Map replay durations were formatted wrong in the replay menu
- Balance: The losing teams’ track reward is now bounded by the amount of spare tracks the winning team has
- Balance: In versus, the drone/bomb fabricator wagon can spawn in shops again; brake and brake track wagons won’t spawn anymore
- Balance: In versus, dynamite, miner wagon and turret don’t affect the other team anymore
- Balance: In versus, turret, compactor, slot & carriage always get an additional positive extension to be more competitive compared to other wagons
- Balance: Mimics will drop players tools/extensions/upgrade instead of deleting or respawning them
