- Improvement: The bot now immediately drops its last item if applicable (instead of carrying it close to the train which can take some time) when the new action has been pressed twice in a short time
- Improvement: Wagon extensions that have no stacked effect (eg. Pull from box extension, ghost, etc) can’t be stacked anymore and won’t appear stacked in shops
- Bug fix: Bot could not water anymore the train with throwing cartridge (regression)
- Bug fix: The transformer wasn’t able to transform compressed commodities
- Bug fix: The train crashed multiple times when an extra life was left in the credits (now we reset them when entering them)
- Bug fix: Fixed multiple occasions where the bot would get stuck or repeat picking placing and the same spot
- Change: Magnet cartridge doesn’t pick milk anymore
