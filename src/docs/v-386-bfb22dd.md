- Bug fix: Popup to handle possible controller issues on MacOS when starting the game
- Improvement: Improved player UI in the main menu to see all cartridges
- Improvement: Bot should not pick up from magnet wagon anymore
- Improvement: Bot now only picks from supercharger, miner & collector when a resource is needed with high priority (eg crafter can’t craft or a specific other wagon is selected)
- Improvement: Show crown only when unlocked in skin menu
- Change: Overwrite stations now allow actually 5 overwrites (instead of 1)
- Improvement: ESC->“Restart” is now only visible when playing custom maps and has a modal confirm
- Improvement: ESC->“Restart from last station” is now available when playing with the toy engine
- Bug fix: When pressing pick/place before going to an element that requires holding the pick/place button, the hold-timer was already running (e.g. cartridges or signpost). Now you can only start pressing once you’re highlighting the item.
- Balance: Turret shoots a tiny bit slower than before when supercharged to the highest level; the water capacity is now related to its supercharged level and not its original level
