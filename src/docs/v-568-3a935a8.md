- Balance: Speed curves for plus-biomes (those that were visited more than once) adapted: Bosses appear now after 2+k stations when visiting the k-th plus-biome. A plus-biome resets its speed to -2 stations of the speed of the station where the boss started to appear. In simpler words: The more plus-biomes you play, the later the boss comes and the start speed in each plus-biome is increased.
- Change: Editor Camera Switch is now on [E] (to not interfere with the “more info” button)
- Bug fix: Some wagons did not work anymore after ~7 speed extensions
- Bug fix: Miner wagon wasn’t mining its correct range when mining horizontally
- Balance: Miner wagon is a little bit slower on level 6
- Balance: Collector is a little bit faster on level 6
- Balance: Cannon wagon is a bit faster on all levels
- Balance: Turret wagon range beyond level 6 goes to 9 (instead of 14); it’s now a bit faster on level 6
- Balance: Speed extensions now consistently change the “speed/frequency” and not the “duration” directly. Practically this means that the speed effect is gets damped with many speed extensions
- Balance: Bucket cartridge capped at 4
- Balance: Slot wagon drop count goes to 9 (instead of 12) when going beyond level 6
- Bug fix: ESC->Feedback should be working again
- Change: Replays are now declared incompatible with the last versions (the highscores are planned to be split again)
