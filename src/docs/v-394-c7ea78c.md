- Improvement: The bucket with milk acts now similar to the bucket buff in U1; The bucket has a certain radius when milk is in it and a timer that only (!) goes down when one ore more players are in the radius. All players in the radius get the buff. However, giving milk explicitly to players is now disabled. It’s rather experimental and probably needs some changes but I’d like to know whether this could be a welcome change
- Freeze fix: Freeze when entering a biome transition station
- Balance: Using hurry, jetpack and ghost cartridge avoids you slowing down on spider webs
- Bug fix: Extra stock chests not working correctly
- Bug fix: Players could continue carrying large stacks even after the crocodile milk was depleted
- Bug fix: In split input mode on the keyboard, it was not possible to hold-press the action-button
- Bug fix: Collector is sometimes not collecting compressed resources
- Balance: Reduced start speed in each biome after monorail meadows (by one station)
