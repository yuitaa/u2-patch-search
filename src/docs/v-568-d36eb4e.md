- Improvement: When a path is drawn (via flag emoji), the bot orients along this path when the actual command is placed not on the map.
- Change: When placing a bridge emoji on the map, the bot is now trying to reach that position (same as with the flag emoji before)
- Improvement: Player and its bot have the same outline. The player name tiles now display whether it’s a bot with a bot icon. The circle under the bot is smaller

- Balance: Rebalanced cartridge prices & rarities (everything is a bit cheaper)
- Balance: You now unlock the cartridge slots automatically by defeating a certain number of bosses
- Balance: Speed curves for plus-biomes (those that were visited more than once) adapted: Bosses appear now after 2+k stations when visiting the k-th plus-biome. A plus-biome resets its speed to -2 - stations of the speed of the station where the boss started to appear. In simpler words: The more plus-biomes you play, the later the boss comes and the start speed in each plus-biome is increased.
- Balance: Miner wagon wasn’t mining its correct range when mining horizontally; It's now a little bit slower on level 6 (with the fix it's probably overall stronger)

- Balance: Turret wagon range beyond level 6 goes to 9 (instead of 14); it’s now a bit faster on level 6
