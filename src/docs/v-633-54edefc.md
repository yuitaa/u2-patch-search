- Bug fix (maybe): Some players can’t connect to lobbies without restarting. Please provide us feedback on this!
- Bug fix: The circle where you can place the teleporter was sometimes not rendered anymore
- Bug fix: Tutorial bubble from stomp action cartridge sometimes doesn’t disappear
- Improvement: Flag respawns the flag to the front when it’s placed behind the train during a shop
- Improvement: Pull from box attached to a compactor wagon only pulls when the box wagon has >= 5 elements and it takes the stack with less already compressed resources
- Improvement: Collector wagon collects now half its output stack iron and the other half wood. Output stack size changed to 6 (from 5) on level 1
- Improvement: Pull from box attached to piggy wagon pulls max 1 item. It also balances the item type and waits longer the less items are left on a box wagon (up to 10 seconds for the last item)
