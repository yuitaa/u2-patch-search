- Improvement: Biome names are displayed in biome transitions
- Improvement: Sound & Music update
- Crash fix: Crash or weird map (eg mountains on tracks) in labyrinth boss fixed
- Crash fix: Crash in (or when leaving) swamp
- Balance: Brake crafter has a smaller output stack size (8 on level 6)
- Balance: Brake tracks craft 12 seconds (instead of 10) on level 6
- Balance: When the train passes multiple train tracks in 3 seconds, the brake cap will be increased. That means that at high speed (> 4m/s), brake tracks brake stronger than a single brake wagon when having multiple in a row. In the same case, brake tracks only last about 3 seconds after the first wagon rolled over one.
- Bug fix: Braking due to brake tracks didnâ€™t reset in blueprint 
- Balance: Speed reduce from slot stations are only active in the current biome (they also appear more often in subsequent biomes again)
- Balance: Boss now targets player more
- Bug fix: Boss Mimics now longer attack after move.
- Bug fix: Editor works again
