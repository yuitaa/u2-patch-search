- Misc: ..All changes from the main branch...
- Improvement: When connecting, there is now a progress displayed in percentage
- Improvement: The connection timeout is now 90 seconds. When joining a high distance game, the initial state transfer can take some time (especially when the uplink of the host is slow). With the new progress you see whether the game is still loading.
- Bug fix: There might be very rare network errors from unclean reconnections
- Bug fix: Players sometimes respawned in the main menu or when restarting a map
- Improvement: Ping paths get cleared when entering and exiting signposts
- Bug fix: Rounding error for the custom map stats
