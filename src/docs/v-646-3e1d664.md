- New: 8 player time mode
- Improvement: Update to Godot 4.5
- Improvement: Performance improvements by multithreading the whole game (this is a big change and might lead to some regressions but it's the technical backbone to support lower end platforms like the Switch and we want to get it stable as quick as we can and more performance improvements are on its way)
- Improvement: Particle emitters are now less resource intensive
- Improvement: Brighter ambient light on very low
- Improvement: The menu now correctly constrains how many players can enter a mode (e.g. only four players in endless etc). Before, an arbitrary amount could enter and some players were put as spectator
- Bug fix (regression): Fix dynamite broken for upper team
- Bug fix: Wagon printer beyond level 6 showed in its description that it could take more tracks than it actually coulda
- Bug fix: Dashing ghosted engines played the horn sound repeatedly (now we donâ€™t play it once ghosted)
