- New: Custom (/Sandbox) mode
- New: Classic mode
- Improvement: Black player ring is a bit brighter
- Improvement: Disallow setting > 1.0 sampling factors in the settings for higher resolutions
- Improvement. Added zoom button to change to a closer player-following camera (added strict-player-follow accessibility setting to disable smoothing)
- Improvement: The camera on resolutions wider than 16/9 (eg ultrawide) is now zooming closer to the map as before (similar to U1)
- Balance: Toy engine stops in time mode before the ending; you can load the last checkpoint with ESC->Load last checkpoint
- Improvement: The HQ node bubble now has a remark saying that this final station will end the run. We also removed the difficulty tag
- Balance: Player speed increased by 2% to match the U1 speed more precisely
