- Improvement: Progress is now shared across all steam users as it led to confusion (progress file renamed to progress_main instead of having a user identifier)
- Bug fix: Time & Classic mode do not unlock
- Balance: A slot station gives a junk cartridge if a player canâ€™t receive more cartridges of the granted type
- Bug fix: Modes did (re)unlock every startup now
- Improvement: Jukebox a bit wider and has now a progress bar
- Balance: 3 bosses to unlock sandbox (instead of 2)
