- New: Introduced max cartridge counts for some cartridge when the effect doesn’t scale indefinitely
- New: A new cartridge slot “Action Cartridge” has been introduced. Players can only own one action cartridge type. Action cartridges use a button (eg [CTRL]/(Y)) to perform the action. Action cartridges are throwing, riding and a some new ones. Note that the cartridge overwrite can’t overwrite action cartridges.
- New: Ghost-Action-Cartridge
- New: Stomp-Action-Cartridge
- New: Jetpack-Action-Cartridge
- New: Hurry-Action-Cartridge
- Change: Riding Cartridge is now an Action-Cartridge: To ride, you need to press the action-cartridge-button. Riding works only a limited time that is based on the amount of riding cartridges you have. While riding, you can do carry/mine/etc and you automatically get the milk buffs of the animal you’re riding
- New: A cartridge (history) selection menu when joining a game in which you missed opportunities to get cartridges. Can also be access via ESC->Cartridge History
- New: “Marathon: Higher probability for longer maps” cartridge added (not distributed at slot stations, similar to hard/easier maps)

- New: Ingame Crowns for any top 10 highscore entry (week, month, year or all time and can be any engine).
- New: You can see personal highscores online when clicking on a name
- Change: We split the highscores with the new version

- Bug fix: The transformer wasn’t able to transform compressed commodities
- Bug fix: The train crashed multiple times when an extra life was left in the credits (now we reset them when entering them)
- Bug fix: It was possible to pick up wagons when transitioning to a blueprint area
- Improvement: The bot now immediately drops its last item if applicable (instead of carrying it close to the train which can take some time) when the new action has been pressed twice in a short time
- Improvement: Bot should not pick up from magnet wagon anymore
- Improvement: Bot now only picks from supercharger, miner & collector when a resource is needed with high priority (eg crafter can’t craft or a specific other wagon is selected)
- Bug fix: Fixed multiple occasions where the bot would get stuck or repeat picking placing and the same spot
- Bug fix: Bot could not water anymore the train with throwing cartridge (regression)
- Bug fix: Bot doesn’t correctly detect the next iron to mine when tide is up

- Change: Players can drink out of the bucket only when carrying something
- Change: 13 wagons is the max for now. It’s actually the same as before but we make it explicit, to avoid wagons bugging around in the shop. We can think of increasing the limit if there is interest for it
- Balance: Animals attached to the milk wagon can’t be hit with the axe/pickaxe anymore
- Balance: Can’t mine animals on carriage wagon anymore
- Balance: Cartridge vaults now only appear on the hard-path on extreme maps. (Eg if you have a lot of nether cartridges s.t. you’d have multiple extreme maps to choose from, only one of them will have a cartridge vault). Also there won’t be 3 cartridge vaults in a row
- Balance: Shops with extreme difficulty now possible and they offer better equipped wagons
- Balance: Stacking has a slightly larger speed penalty
- Balance: Increased running cartridge cap to 17; they also compensate now exactly the carrying slowdown (eg 5 carrying and 5 running gives you normal speed when carrying 8 items)
- Balance: Reduced throwing per level increase to 1m
- Balance: Turret shoots a tiny bit slower than before when supercharged to the highest level; the water capacity is now related to its supercharged level and not its original level
- Change: In swamp you can now ride the frog instead of the spider & the spider can’t be carried anymore
- Balance: Frog has 9 health now instead of 1
