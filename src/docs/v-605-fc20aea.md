- Improvement: Music dims when the spider queen is watching
- Improvement: Roll Mart Soundtrack is playing in the classic shop
- Improvement: Classic mode shows the biome title banner when entering a new biome (similar to endless)
- Balance: Biomes can also be unlocked when playing classic mode
- Bug fix: Bots tried to avoid non-activated bombs in versus
- Bug fix: The new cartridges did not get sampled correctly in endless
- Change: We default some AMD cards to OpenGL as there are often visual glichtes in both DX12 & Vulkan (you can still manually change the driver and we're trying to debug this issue)
