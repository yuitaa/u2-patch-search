- freeze fix: Several mapgen improvements and fixes that should avoid infinite loading screens when entering a new map:
- Bug fix: Canyon boss map didn’t spawn correctly and canyon boss did not spawn at all
- Improvement: ATI GPUs now default to the Angle backend;  Iris Xe GPUs should now default to Vulkan
- Improvement: Pusher engine starts in the middle of crafter and box now in Time Attack just like in Endless
- Improvement: Time Attack chest stations spawn a “move wagon to the front” extension as well
- Improvement: In Time Attack labyrinth maps, the ground sometimes shakes but doesn’t change or it even shakes below the train
- Improvement: Localization improvements
- Improvement: Improved game end distance statistics (and fixed the Labyrinth color)
- Bug fix: Brake tracks didn't get auto picked
- Bug fix: Cassette was missing on the labyrinth boss map
